The goal of these lectures is to introduce the great R-universe, and especially the `{tidyverse}`. This not only means displaying the packages, but also the great community that makes R so alive: the plethora of open source and open access resources, the live casts, and the extensive set of tools to create websites, publications and presentations.

## Contents

* [`r-best-practices`](./lecture_01-r_best_practices/r_best_practices.qmd) [ðŸŽ¥ slides](https://luca.quarto.pub/r_best_practices/#/r-best-practices). This lecture will introduce some of the most important software engineering practices when working with R (which could extend to any other programming language).
* [`into-the-tidyverse`](./lecture_02-dive_into_the_tidyverse/2022_11_15_tidy_tuesday.qmd). This lecture will introduce the `{tidyverse}` through Dave Robinsons' screencasts of the TidyTuesday data challenges.
